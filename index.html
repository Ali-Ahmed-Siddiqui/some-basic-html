    <h1><u>Sciene kn0wledege:</u></h1>
    <p>
        There is science everywhere, the way you see, respond, talk, listen all contains science. It is a science that
        sometimes looks like a <b>miracle</b>. Science plays a very important <b>role</b> in our lives. There is
        science everywhere but we learn about them when we visit our school.<br>

        There is nothing which science cannot do in our life. If you are alone, you can watch a movie. If you are
        hungry, you can order food within a few minutes.<br>

        All these things show how important science is and you cannot keep science apart from your daily life. Really it
        is like a miracle and I cannot imagine life without Sciene.in <def>my own word</def> science is just a subject
        so please its not be consider others<br>
        <b><i>the some brance of science is given below</b></i>;

    <h2><u>Chemistry:</u></h2>

    Chemistry primarily focuses on atoms, ions, and molecules which, in turn, make up elements and compounds.<br> These
    chemical species tend to interact with each other through chemical bonds.<br> It is important to note that the
    interactions between matter and energy are also studied in the field of chemistry.<br>
    the <strong> formula of water</strong> is <b>H<subscript>2</subscript>O</b> and the formula Calcium acetate is <b>C
        <subscript>₄</subscript>H
    </b>
